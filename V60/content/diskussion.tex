\noindent
The general preciseness of the measurement of the threshold really depends on the adjustment skills of the 
experimentator. 

\noindent
Another difficulty of the experiment was that the knobs of the laser are really sensetive to small
mechanical disturbances. A little hit on the table changed already the adjustment made. 
Also it was hard to find the right knob adjustment as well as the right currents to pick as well as the right
frequency.

\noindent
Also the oscilloscope behaved strangly while measuring. Sometimes no signal got detected and other times 
the oscilloscope had to be restarted (no changes to the settings where made) to get the expected picture back.
