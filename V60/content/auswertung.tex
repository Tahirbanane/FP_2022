\section{Results}

\subsection{Threshold current}
The threshold current gets detected at $$ I_{\text{threshold}} = 34.1 \text{mA} \, . $$

The following pictures are taken from the videoscreen of the camera and show the laserbeam slightly below (a) und 
slightly above (b) the threshold. The difference in the intensity of the light is really good to see.

\subsection{Rubidium fluorescence}
The fluorescence light of the Rubidium is emitted along the laser beam. This can be observed in the picture
\ref{fig:ffl}. The yellow horizontal line is the light of interest, the lower one is just a reflection
which occured by the angle.

\subsection{Rubidium absorption spectrum}
In figure \ref{fig:abs} the measured absorption spectrum is shown in yellow. The blue trace is the piezo
monitor, which shows the voltage on the piezoelectric stack as a function of time.

\noindent
The adjustment of the laser seems to be perfect since there are 4 dips as expected (so no mode hops). The 
expected graph and the reason for it is shown in figure \ref{fig:lit}.
